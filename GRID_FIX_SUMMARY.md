# SimpleGrid Component - Initialization Fix Summary

## Problem
The grid component was initializing multiple times because:
1. `onAttributeChange` was being called for each attribute during initial setup
2. Each attribute change was triggering `initializeGrid()`
3. `onConnected` was also calling `initializeGrid()`
4. The grid container didn't exist yet when trying to initialize

## Solution
We implemented several fixes:

### 1. **Initialization Guard**
- Added `initializationPending` flag to prevent concurrent initializations
- Added `isConnected` flag to track component lifecycle state

### 2. **Deferred Initialization**
- Moved initialization from `onConnected` to `addEventListeners`
- This ensures the template is rendered before trying to find the grid container
- The grid now initializes after the first render when the DOM is ready

### 3. **Attribute Change Optimization**
- `onAttributeChange` now ignores changes before the component is connected
- Only reinitializes when attributes change after initial setup
- Groups attribute changes to avoid multiple reinitializations

### 4. **Event Listener Management**
- Renamed grid-specific event listeners to `addGridEventListeners`
- Properly clears and re-attaches event listeners after grid updates
- Handles Grid.js 'ready' and 'load' events properly

## Key Changes Made

1. **Constructor**: Added initialization flags
```javascript
this.initializationPending = false;
this.isConnected = false;
```

2. **onConnected**: Only parses attributes, doesn't initialize
```javascript
async onConnected() {
    this.isConnected = true;
    // Parse attributes but don't initialize yet
    this.endpoint = this.getAttr("data-source");
    this.clickableColumns = this.parseClickableColumnsAttr();
    const mode = this.getAttr("mode") || 'client';
    this.setState({ mode });
}
```

3. **addEventListeners**: Override to initialize after render
```javascript
addEventListeners() {
    super.addEventListeners();
    // Initialize grid after first render
    if (this.endpoint && !this.initializationPending && !this.gridInstance) {
        this.initializeGrid();
    }
}
```

4. **onAttributeChange**: Skip if not connected
```javascript
async onAttributeChange(name, oldVal, newVal) {
    if (!this.isConnected) {
        return;
    }
    // ... handle changes
}
```

## Result
The grid now:
- Initializes only once after the component is fully rendered
- Properly handles attribute changes without multiple initializations
- Maintains proper event listener lifecycle
- Shows loading state correctly
- Handles errors gracefully

## Testing
Created test files:
- `/workspace/test-grid.html` - Basic grid test
- `/workspace/test-grid-simple.html` - Direct Grid.js test
- `/workspace/test-grid-final.html` - Comprehensive test with controls
- `/workspace/test-server.js` - Mock server for testing

The grid component is now stable and performs well without multiple initializations.
